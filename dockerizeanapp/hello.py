# Given an application, package it into a container using docker
# The application can be:
# - a simple GET endpoint with no body request
# - a console app with a ‘hello world’ message
# - a web app
# - any application that you want

# Once the application is containerized, you should be able to use it once the container is up and running

print("Hello, Docker World!")
